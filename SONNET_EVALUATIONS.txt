============================================================================

OVERALL ASSESSMENT: Sonnet's implementation demonstrates strong understanding of Go testing practices with comprehensive coverage and proper test structure. However, it has several compilation issues and some functional gaps.

============================================================================
DETAILED CRITERION EVALUATIONS
============================================================================

CRITERION 1: The code should implement test cases for all supported input video formats (.mp4, .mkv, .mov, .avi, .webm, .flv, .wmv) including edge cases like corrupted files and unsupported formats.
Type: Correctness | Necessity: Explicit

RATING: MINOR ISSUE

EVALUATION: Sonnet's TestSupportedFormats in main_test.go (lines 242-270) tests all 7 required video formats (.mp4, .mkv, .mov, .avi, .webm, .flv, .wmv) plus edge cases like unsupported formats (.xyz), empty extensions, and case insensitivity. However, it lacks corrupted file testing despite this being explicitly mentioned in the criterion.

PROOF: TestSupportedFormats shows:
✓ All 7 formats tested: ".mp4", ".mkv", ".mov", ".avi", ".webm", ".flv", ".wmv"
✓ Edge cases: ".xyz" (unsupported), "" (no extension), ".MP4" (case insensitive)
✗ No corrupted file testing implementation
✓ Proper validation logic using SupportedInputFormats array

============================================================================

CRITERION 2: The code should include comprehensive input path validation tests covering directory traversal attacks, special characters, non-existent files, empty files, permission-denied scenarios, and system directory access attempts.
Type: Security | Necessity: Explicit

RATING: NO ISSUE

EVALUATION: Sonnet's validation_test.go provides excellent coverage of security scenarios. TestValidateInputPath covers all required security aspects including directory traversal attacks, empty inputs, non-existent files, directories instead of files, invalid extensions, empty files, and path quote handling.

PROOF: TestValidateInputPath shows comprehensive coverage:
✓ Directory traversal: "../../../etc/passwd" test (line 51)
✓ Empty input and whitespace-only tests (lines 35, 42)
✓ Non-existent files test (line 49)
✓ Directory instead of file test (line 56)
✓ Invalid file extension test (line 63)
✓ Empty file test (line 70)
✓ Quote handling tests (lines 77, 84)
TestValidatePathCharacters tests null byte injection and platform-specific invalid characters.

============================================================================

CRITERION 3: The code should test AI upscaling functionality with Real-ESRGAN across all scaling modes (2x, 4x upscaling and 2x, 4x, 8x downscaling) and handle cases where Real-ESRGAN is not available or fails.
Type: Correctness | Necessity: Explicit

RATING: MINOR ISSUE

EVALUATION: Sonnet's upscaling_test.go covers configuration validation and basic upscaling functionality but lacks explicit testing of all scaling modes. TestValidateConfig tests invalid scales (5, -3) and valid downscaling (-2) but doesn't systematically test all required modes (2x, 4x, -2x, -4x, -8x).

PROOF: upscaling_test.go shows:
✓ Configuration validation: TestValidateConfig
✓ Model validation: TestUpscalingModels
✓ Memory estimation: TestEstimateMemoryUsage  
✓ GPU detection: TestGetGPUInfo
✗ Missing explicit tests for all scaling modes (2x, 4x, -2x, -4x, -8x)
✓ Invalid scale testing (line 93: Scale: 5, line 103: Scale: -3)

============================================================================

CRITERION 4: The code should validate output file path generation and creation for all supported output formats (GIF, APNG, WebP, AVIF, MP4, WebM) including cases where output directories don't exist or lack write permissions.
Type: Correctness | Necessity: Explicit

RATING: MINOR ISSUE

EVALUATION: Sonnet tests output path validation in TestValidateOutputPath but focuses on general path validation rather than format-specific testing. All 6 output formats are referenced in TestConversionConfigValidation but there's no dedicated output format generation testing.

PROOF: 
✓ Output path validation: TestValidateOutputPath in validation_test.go
✓ Format validation: validFormats map in main_test.go includes all 6 formats
✗ No dedicated output file generation tests for each format
✗ Limited write permission testing (test failures show permission issues)
RUNTIME ERROR: TestValidateOutputPath failures show issues with directory detection logic

============================================================================

CRITERION 5: The code should test memory estimation and GPU detection functionality for AI upscaling, including scenarios with insufficient memory and different GPU configurations (CUDA, MPS, CPU-only).
Type: Correctness | Necessity: Implicit

RATING: MINOR ISSUE

EVALUATION: TestEstimateMemoryUsage covers basic memory estimation with different resolutions, and TestGetGPUInfo tests GPU detection. However, insufficient memory scenarios and specific GPU configuration testing are not implemented.

PROOF: upscaling_test.go shows:
✓ Memory estimation: TestEstimateMemoryUsage tests HD, 4K, small resolutions
✓ GPU detection: TestGetGPUInfo tests basic GPU info retrieval
✗ No insufficient memory scenario testing
✗ No specific CUDA/MPS/CPU-only configuration testing

============================================================================

CRITERION 6: The code should implement edge case testing for video processing parameters including invalid time ranges (start > end, negative values), extreme frame rates, and zero-duration videos.
Type: Correctness | Necessity: Explicit

RATING: MINOR ISSUE

EVALUATION: TestConversionConfigValidation tests invalid time ranges (start > end) and invalid frame rates (0) but lacks comprehensive edge case coverage for negative values, extreme frame rates, and zero-duration videos.

PROOF: main_test.go shows:
✓ Invalid time range: StartTime: 10.0, EndTime: 5.0 test (lines 180-191)
✓ Invalid frame rate: FrameRate: 0 test (lines 192-202)
✗ No negative time value testing
✗ No extreme frame rate testing (e.g., 1000fps, 0.1fps)
✗ No zero-duration video testing

============================================================================

CRITERION 7: The code should test the complete user interaction flow including cancellation scenarios, invalid user inputs, and default value handling across all prompt stages.
Type: Correctness | Necessity: Explicit

RATING: MAJOR ISSUE

EVALUATION: Sonnet provides no testing for user interaction flows. While TestCleanInputPath and TestProcessOutputPath test path processing functions, there's no testing of the actual user prompt interactions, cancellation scenarios, or default value handling.

PROOF: No tests found for:
✗ User prompt interactions (getStartTime, getEndTime, getFrameRate, etc.)
✗ Cancellation scenarios
✗ Invalid user input handling  
✗ Default value handling across prompt stages
Only path processing utility functions are tested.

============================================================================

CRITERION 8: The code should validate FFmpeg integration and error handling for scenarios where FFmpeg is not installed, returns errors, or produces invalid output.
Type: Correctness | Necessity: Explicit

RATING: NO ISSUE

EVALUATION: ffmpeg_test.go provides comprehensive FFmpeg integration testing including availability detection, media validation, argument construction, quality profiles, and error handling scenarios.

PROOF: ffmpeg_test.go shows excellent coverage:
✓ FFmpeg availability: TestIsFFmpegAvailable
✓ Media validation: TestValidateMediaFile with various error scenarios
✓ Argument construction: TestBuildFFmpegArgs for GIF, MP4, WebP
✓ Quality profiles: TestQualityProfiles and TestApplyQualityProfile
✓ Error scenarios: Non-existent files, empty paths, invalid media files

============================================================================

CRITERION 9: The code should use Go's testing framework with proper test organization, setup/teardown functions, and table-driven tests for comprehensive coverage.
Type: Coding Style | Necessity: Implicit

RATING: NO ISSUE

EVALUATION: Sonnet demonstrates excellent Go testing practices with proper test organization, extensive use of table-driven tests, helper functions, and proper use of t.TempDir() for cleanup.

PROOF: Excellent testing patterns throughout:
✓ Table-driven tests: All major test functions use proper table structures
✓ Test organization: Clear function naming, proper test grouping
✓ Helper functions: createTempVideoFile, createValidMP4File in main_test.go
✓ Cleanup: Proper use of t.TempDir(), defer statements
✓ Subtest structure: t.Run() used consistently for test organization

============================================================================

CRITERION 10: The code should implement mock interfaces for external dependencies (FFmpeg, Python/Real-ESRGAN, file system operations) to enable isolated unit testing.
Type: Efficiency & Performance | Necessity: Implicit

RATING: MAJOR ISSUE

EVALUATION: Sonnet's implementation lacks any mocking interfaces. Tests directly call external dependencies like FFmpeg and Real-ESRGAN, which makes tests dependent on system configuration and reduces reliability.

PROOF: No mocking implementation found:
✗ FFmpeg tests call actual ffmpeg commands
✗ Real-ESRGAN tests use actual Python/system dependencies
✗ File system operations use real filesystem
✗ No dependency injection or interface abstractions for testing

============================================================================

CRITERION 11: The code should test file size validation including edge cases like files exactly at the 500MB limit, empty files, and extremely large files that exceed system limits.
Type: Correctness | Necessity: Explicit

RATING: NO ISSUE

EVALUATION: TestFileSizeValidation comprehensively tests file size limits including the exact 500MB limit, files exceeding the limit, empty files, and normal sizes.

PROOF: main_test.go TestFileSizeValidation shows:
✓ Small file: 1MB test
✓ Exact limit: MaxFileSizeBytes test
✓ Exceeds limit: MaxFileSizeBytes + 1 test  
✓ Empty file: 0 bytes test
✓ Proper validation logic: tt.fileSize > 0 && tt.fileSize <= MaxFileSizeBytes

============================================================================

CRITERION 12: The code should validate temporary file cleanup and resource management during AI upscaling, ensuring no orphaned files or memory leaks occur even when operations fail.
Type: Efficiency & Performance | Necessity: Implicit

RATING: MAJOR ISSUE

EVALUATION: No tests validate temporary file cleanup or resource management during AI upscaling operations. While basic upscaling configuration is tested, there's no verification of cleanup behavior or failure scenario resource management.

PROOF: Missing throughout upscaling_test.go:
✗ No temporary file cleanup testing
✗ No resource management validation during failures
✗ No orphaned file detection tests
✗ No memory leak prevention testing

============================================================================

CRITERION 13: The code should include comprehensive error message testing to ensure user-friendly error reporting for all failure scenarios with specific guidance for resolution.
Type: Readability & Maintainability | Necessity: Implicit

RATING: MINOR ISSUE

EVALUATION: Tests validate that errors occur but provide limited testing of error message quality and user-friendliness. Most tests use assert.Contains for basic error message validation.

PROOF: Good error checking patterns but limited message quality testing:
✓ Error message validation: strings.Contains(err.Error(), expectedMsg) used consistently
✓ Multiple error scenarios tested across modules
✗ No testing of error message helpfulness or resolution guidance
✗ Limited validation of user-friendly error formatting

============================================================================

CRITERION 14: The code should test concurrent operations and thread safety for scenarios where multiple conversion processes might run simultaneously or be interrupted.
Type: Correctness | Necessity: Implicit

RATING: MAJOR ISSUE

EVALUATION: No concurrent operations or thread safety testing implemented. All tests run sequentially without any goroutines, channels, or race condition testing.

PROOF: No concurrency testing found in any test files:
✗ No goroutine usage in tests
✗ No race condition testing
✗ No concurrent conversion process testing
✗ No interruption scenario testing

============================================================================

CRITERION 15: The code should implement integration tests that verify the complete end-to-end workflow from input validation through AI processing to final output generation, including cleanup verification.
Type: Correctness | Necessity: Explicit

RATING: MAJOR ISSUE

EVALUATION: While individual components are well-tested, there are no integration tests that verify the complete end-to-end workflow. Tests are focused on unit testing individual functions rather than full workflow integration.

PROOF: Missing integration testing:
✗ No end-to-end workflow tests
✗ No integration between validation → upscaling → conversion → output
✗ No cleanup verification in full workflows
✗ Tests focus on individual component functionality only

============================================================================
COMPILATION ISSUES
============================================================================

CRITICAL COMPILATION FAILURES:
✗ Unused imports in main_test.go: "time", "mediaengine/internal/upscaling", "mediaengine/internal/validation", "mediaengine/internal/video"
✗ Unused imports in upscaling_test.go: "os", "path/filepath"

RUNTIME TEST FAILURES:
✗ TestValidateInputPathComprehensive fails due to FFprobe validation on dummy files
